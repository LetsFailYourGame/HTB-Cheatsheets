## Domain Takeovers & Subdomain Enumeration
* `Domain takeover` is registering a non-existent domain name to gain control over another domain
* If an attacker finds expired domains, they can claim that domain to perform further attacks such as hosting malicious content on a website or sending a phishing email leveraging the claimed domain
* Also possible with subdomains called `subdomain takeover`
* Many organizations use third-party services like AWS, GitHub, Akamai, Fastly, and other content delivery networks (CDNs) to host their content
* In this case, they usually create a subdomain and make it point to those services

```sh
sub.target.com.   60   IN   CNAME   anotherdomain.com
```

* Suppose the `anotherdomain.com` expires and is available for anyone to claim the domain since the `target.com`'s DNS server has the `CNAME` record
* In that case, anyone who registers `anotherdomain.com` will have complete control over `sub.target.com` until the DNS record is updated

#### Subdomain Enumeration

```sh
./subfinder -d inlanefreight.com -v       
                                                                       
        _     __ _         _                                           
____  _| |__ / _(_)_ _  __| |___ _ _          
(_-< || | '_ \  _| | ' \/ _  / -_) '_|                 
/__/\_,_|_.__/_| |_|_||_\__,_\___|_| v2.4.5

#### Subbrute
* This tool allows us to use self-defined resolvers and perform pure DNS brute-forcing attacks during internal penetration tests on hosts that do not have Internet access

```sh
git clone https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute.git >> /dev/null 2>&1
cd subbrute
echo "ns1.inlanefreight.com" > ./resolvers.txt
./subbrute inlanefreight.com -s ./names.txt -r ./resolvers.txt

Warning: Fewer than 16 resolvers per process, consider adding more nameservers to resolvers.txt.
inlanefreight.com
ns2.inlanefreight.com
www.inlanefreight.com
ms1.inlanefreight.com
support.inlanefreight.com

<SNIP>
```

* Another scenario would be that we have reached an internal host through pivoting and want to work from there
* Using the `nslookup` or `host` command, we can enumerate the `CNAME` records for those subdomains

```sh
host support.inlanefreight.com

support.inlanefreight.com is an alias for inlanefreight.s3.amazonaws.com
```

* The `support` subdomain has an alias record pointing to an AWS S3 bucket
* However, the URL `https://support.inlanefreight.com` shows a `NoSuchBucket` error indicating that the subdomain is potentially vulnerable to a subdomain takeover
* Now, we can take over the subdomain by creating an AWS S3 bucket with the same subdomain name
* The [can-i-take-over-xyz](https://github.com/EdOverflow/can-i-take-over-xyz) repository is also an excellent reference for a subdomain takeover vulnerability
* It shows whether the target services are vulnerable to a subdomain takeover and provides guidelines on assessing the vulnerability

## DNS Spoofing
* Also referred to as DNS Cache Poisoning

#### Local DNS Cache Poisoning
* Using MITM tools like [Ettercap](https://www.ettercap-project.org/) or [Bettercap](https://www.bettercap.org/)
* First edit the `/etc/ettercap/etter.dns` file to map the target domain name (e.g., `inlanefreight.com`) that they want to spoof and the attacker's IP address (e.g., `192.168.225.110`) that they want to redirect a user to

```shell-session
cat /etc/ettercap/etter.dns

inlanefreight.com      A   192.168.225.110
*.inlanefreight.com    A   192.168.225.110
```

* Start Ettercap and scan for hosts `Hosts > Scan for Hosts`
* Once completed, add the target IP address (e.g., `192.168.152.129`) to Target1 and add a default gateway IP (e.g., `192.168.152.2`) to Target2
* Activate `dns_spoof` attack by navigating to `Plugins > Manage Plugins`
