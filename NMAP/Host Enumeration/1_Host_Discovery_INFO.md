### Host Discovery
#### Scan Network Range
* ICMP echo requests

```bash
$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -sn -oA tnet | grep for | cut -d" " -f5

10.129.2.4
10.129.2.10
10.129.2.11
10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
10.129.2.28
```

#### Used Scanning Options
* `10.129.2.0/24` `-sn` `-oA tnet`
* Only works if firewalls of the hosts allow it
* Otherwise use other scanning techniques to find out if hosts are active or not
	* Firewall and IDS Evasion

### Scan IP List
* Work with multiple targets defined in a list

```bash
$ cat hosts.lst

10.129.2.4
10.129.2.10
10.129.2.11
10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
10.129.2.28
```

* We can then specify the list with `-iL hosts.lst`

#### Used Scanning Options
* `-sn` `-oA tnet` `-iL hosts.lst`
* Other hosts can still ignore the default ICMP echo requests because of the firewall
* If NMAP does not get a response it will mark the target as down

### Scan Multiple IPs
* If we want to scan only a small part of a Network, we can specify multiple IP addresses manually

```bash
$ sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet 10.129.2.18 10.129.2.19 10.129.2.20| grep for | cut -d" " -f5

10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
```

* Or define a range if they are next to each other

```bash
$ sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet 10.129.2.18-20| grep for | cut -d" " -f5

10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
```

### Scan Single IP
* First, determine if it's alive or not

```bash
$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host 

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-14 23:59 CEST
Nmap scan report for 10.129.2.18
Host is up (0.087s latency).
MAC Address: DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.11 seconds
```

#### Used Scanning Options
* `10.129.2.18` `-sn` `-oA host`
* With `-sn` we are disabling port scanning
	* NMAP automatically pings with the ICMP Echo Request (`-PE`)
	* Before only ARP ping's have been sent resulting in an ARP reply
* To ensure ICMP echo requests are sent we use `-PE`

```bash
$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace 

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-15 00:08 CEST

Host is up (0.023s latency).
MAC Address: DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF

```

* Another option is the `--reason` flag

```bash
$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --reason 

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-15 00:10 CEST
SENT (0.0074s) ARP who-has 10.129.2.18 tell 10.10.14.2
RCVD (0.0309s) ARP reply 10.129.2.18 is-at DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF
Nmap scan report for 10.129.2.18
Host is up, received arp-response (0.028s latency).
MAC Address: DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.03 seconds
```

* We can see that NMAP does detect the host trough AR requests and ARP reply alone
* To disable ARP requests and scan with ICMP echo requests we use `-disable-arp-ping`

```bash
$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace --disable-arp-ping
