### Nmap
* Enumerate ports, services, OS, etc. on the target machine

```bash
# A simple nmap scan which scans top 1000 ports

$ nmap 10.129.42.253

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-02-25 16:07 EST

```

* We can use the `-sC` parameter to run nmap's common scripts for more detailed information
* We can use the `-sV` parameter to run a version scan
	* Fingerprint services on the target system
	* Identify protocols, application name, and version
* We can use the `-p-` parameter to scan all 65,535 ports
	* This takes a lot of time and is very “loud”

#### Nmap Scripts
* `-sC` runs many useful default scripts
* Sometimes specific scripts are required
	* Use the `locate` keyword to find specific scripts
* Syntax for running scripts `nmap --script <script name> -p<port> <host>`

### Attacking Network Services
#### Banner Grabbing
* Useful technique to fingerprint services quickly
* Nmap attempt to grab the banner if specified
	* `nmap -sV --script=banner <target>`
* Or manually using `Netcat`

```bash
$ nc -nv 10.129.42.253 21

(UNKNOWN) [10.129.42.253] 21 (ftp) open
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.3)
```

* This reveals the version of `vsFTPd` is `3.0.3`

#### FTP
* Often contain interesting data

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -p21 10.129.42.253

#### SMB
* Server Message Block
* Protocol on Windows machines that provides many vectors for vertical and lateral movement
	* Sensitive data, including credentials, can be in network file shares
	* Some versions vulnerable to RCE
* Nmap has many scripts for enumerating SMB

```bash
nmap --script smb-os-discovery.nse -p445 10.10.10.40

Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-12-27 00:59 GMT

#### Shares
* Share folders and make them accessible remotely
* Tool for `enumerating SMB shares` is called `smbclient`
	* The `-L` flag specifies that we want to retrieve a list of available shares on the remote host
	* To suppress the password prompt use `-N` 

```bash
$ smbclient -N -L \\\\10.129.42.253

	Sharename       Type      Comment
	---------       ----      -------
	print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
	users           Disk      
	IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (gs-svcscan server (Samba, Ubuntu))
SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
```

* This reveals a non-default user `users`

```bash
# Connect to the share

$ smbclient \\\\10.129.42.253\\users

Enter WORKGROUP\users password:

# Access denied shows that guests access is not permitted

$ smbclient -U bob \\\\10.129.42.253\\users

#### SNMP
* Provide information and statistics about a router or device
* Manufacturer default community strings of `public` and `private` are often unchanged
* In SNMP versions 1 and 2c, access is controlled using a plaintext community string
	* If we know the name we can gain access to it
	* Encryption and authentication were only added in SNMP version 3

```bash
# -v 1|2c|3      specifies SNMP version to use
# -c COMMUNITY   set the community string

$ snmpwalk -v 2c -c public 10.129.42.253 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0

iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 = STRING: "gs-svcscan"
```

```bash
$ snmpwalk -v 2c -c private 10.129.42.253 

Timeout: No Response from 10.129.42.253
```
