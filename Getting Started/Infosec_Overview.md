### Infosec Overview
* Many specializations grown in the last years
* Network and infrastructure security
  * Application security
  * Security testing
  * Systems auditing
  * Business continuity planning
  * Digital forensics
  * Incident detection and response
* Infosec is practice of protecting data from unauthorized access, changes, unlawful use, disruption, etc.
* Reduce the impact of any such incident
* `protect the "confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data,"` or the **CIA triad**"

### Risk Management Process
* Data protection has to be efficient and effective
* Organizations must follow a Process called `risk management process`

| Step      | Explanation |
| :---        |    :----:   |
| Identifying the Risk      | Identifying risks the business is exposed to, such as legal, environmental, market, regulatory, and other types of risks.       |
| Analyze the Risk   | Analyzing the risks to determine their impact and probability. The risks should be mapped to the organization's various policies, procedures, and business processes.        |
| Evaluate the Risk | Evaluating, ranking, and prioritizing risks. Then, the organization must decide to accept (unavoidable), avoid (change plans), control (mitigate), or transfer risk (insure).
| Dealing with Risk | Eliminating or containing the risks as best as possible. This is handled by interfacing directly with the stakeholders for the system or process that the risk is associated with.
| Monitoring Risk | All risks must be constantly monitored. Risks should be constantly monitored for any situational changes that could change their impact score, `i.e., from low to medium or high impact`.

### Red Team vs. Blue Team
* Red Team
  * Attackers
  * Try to train the Blue
* Blue Team
  * Defenders
  * Strengthen the organizations defense

### Role of Penetration Testers
* Helps to identify risks in its external and internal networks
* Includes network or web application vulnerabilities, sensitive data exposure, misconfigurations, or issues that could lead to reputational harm
* White-box Penetration tests, phishing, red team etc.
