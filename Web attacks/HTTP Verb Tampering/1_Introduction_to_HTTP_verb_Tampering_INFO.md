* Programmers mostly consider only `GET` and `POST`
* Web application can break if not developed to handle for example `HEAD` or `PUT`

## HTTP Verb Tampering
* Commonly used HTTP verbs

| Verb    | Description                                                                                         |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HEAD    | Identical to a GET request, but its response only contains theÂ `headers`, without the response body |
| PUT     | Writes the request payload to the specified location                                                |
| DELETE  | Deletes the resource at the specified location                                                      |
| OPTIONS | Shows different options accepted by a web server, like accepted HTTP verbs                          |
| PATCH   | Apply partial modifications to the resource at the specified location                                                                                                     |


## Insecure Configurations
* Insecure web server configurations cause the first type of HTTP Verb Tampering vulnerabilities

```xml
<Limit GET POST>
    Require valid-user
</Limit>
```

* Attacker may still use other HTTP methods like `HEAD` which could bypass the authentication

## Insecure Coding
* This can occur when a web developer applies specific filters to mitigate particular vulnerabilities while not covering all HTTP methods with that filter
* For example, admin tries to fix a SQL injection by using a regex pattern which only looks for a GET method

```php
$pattern = "/^[A-Za-z\s]+$/";

if(preg_match($pattern, $_GET["code"])) {
    $query = "Select * from ports where port_code like '%" . $_REQUEST["code"] . "%'";
    ...SNIP...
}
```
