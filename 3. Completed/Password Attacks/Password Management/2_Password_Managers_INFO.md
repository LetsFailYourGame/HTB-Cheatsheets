## How Does a Password Manager Work?
* Most work with a master password to encrypt the database
* The encryption and authentication work using different [Cryptographic hash functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) and [key derivations functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function), to prevent unauthorized access to our encrypted password database and its content

## Online Password Managers
* One of the key elements when deciding on a password manager is convenience
* A typical person has 3 or 4 devices and uses them to log in to different websites, applications, etc
* An online password manager allows the user to synchronize its encrypted password database between multiples devices, most of them provide
	- A mobile application
	- A browser add-on
* Most popular online password managers are:
	1.  [1Password](https://1password.com/)
	2.  [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
	3.  [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/)
	4.  [Keeper](https://www.keepersecurity.com/)
	5.  [Lastpass](https://www.lastpass.com/)
	6.  [NordPass](https://nordpass.com/)
	7.  [RoboForm](https://www.roboform.com/)

## Local Password Managers
* Some companies and individuals prefer to manage their security for different reasons and not rely on services provided by third parties
* Local password managers offer this option by storing the database locally and putting the responsibility on the user to protect their content and the location where it is stored
