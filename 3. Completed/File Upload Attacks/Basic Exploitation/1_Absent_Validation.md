The most basic type of file upload vulnerability occurs when the web application `does not have any form of validation filters` on the uploaded files, allowing the upload of any file type by default.

With these types of vulnerable web apps, we may directly upload our web shell or reverse shell script to the web application, and then by just visiting the uploaded script, we can interact with our web shell or send the reverse shell.

## Arbitrary File Upload

![](file_uploads_file_manager.jpg)

* The web application does not mention anything about what file types are allowed, and we can drag and drop any file we want, and its name will appear on the upload form, including `.php` files

![](file_uploads_file_selected_php_file.jpg)

* Furthermore, if we click on the form to select a file, the file selector dialog does not specify any file type, as it says `All Files` for the file type, which may also suggest that no type of restrictions or limitations are specified for the web application

* All of this tells us that the program appears to have no file type restrictions on the front-end, and if no restrictions were specified on the back-end, we might be able to upload arbitrary file types to the back-end server to gain complete control over it

## Identifying Web Framework

We need to upload a malicious script to test whether we can upload any file type to the back-end server and test whether we can use this to exploit the back-end server. Many kinds of scripts can help us exploit web applications through arbitrary file upload, most commonly a `Web Shell` script and a `Reverse Shell` script.

This is usually relatively simple, as we can often see the web page extension in the URLs, which may reveal the programming language that runs the web application. However, in certain web frameworks and web languages, `Web Routes` are used to map URLs to web pages, in which case the web page extension may not be shown. Furthermore, file upload exploitation would also be different, as our uploaded files may not be directly routable or accessible.

One easy method to determine what language runs the web application is to visit the `/index.ext` page, where we would swap out `ext` with various common web extensions, like `php`, `asp`, `aspx`, among others, to see whether any of them exist.

For example, when we visit our exercise below, we see its URL as `http://SERVER_IP:PORT/`, as the `index` page is usually hidden by default. But, if we try visiting `http://SERVER_IP:PORT/index.php`, we would get the same page, which means that this is indeed a `PHP` web application. We do not need to do this manually, of course, as we can use a tool like Burp Intruder for fuzzing the file extension using a [Web Extensions](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt) wordlist, as we will see in upcoming sections. This method may not always be accurate, though, as the web application may not utilize index pages or may utilize more than one web extension.

Several other techniques may help identify the technologies running the web application, like using the [Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/) extension, which is available for all major browsers. Once added to our browser, we can click its icon to view all technologies running the web application.

## Vulnerability Identification
* As an initial test to identify whether we can upload arbitrary `PHP` files, let's create a basic `Hello World` script to test whether we can execute `PHP` code with our uploaded file
* `<?php echo "Hello HTB";?>` to `test.php`

![](file_uploads_upload_php.jpg)

* We get a message saying `File successfully uploaded`, which means that `the web application has no file validation whatsoever on the back-end`
* Now, we can click the `Download` button, and the web application will take us to our uploaded file
* As we can see, the page prints our `Hello HTB` message, which means that the `echo` function was executed to print our string, and we successfully executed `PHP` code on the back-end server
