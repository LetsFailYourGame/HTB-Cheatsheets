* [CVE-2019-0708](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2019-0708) leads to RCE
* Known as `BlueKeep`
* Does not require prior access to the system to exploit the service for our purposes

**Note**: This is a flaw that we will likely run into during our penetration tests, but it can cause system instability, including a "blue screen of death (BSoD)," and we should be careful before using the associated exploit. If in doubt, it's best to first speak with our client so they understand the risks and then decide if they would like us to run the exploit or not.
