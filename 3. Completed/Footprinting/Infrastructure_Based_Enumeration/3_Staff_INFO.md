### LinkedIn - Employee #1 About
* Sometimes Organisations are sharing things like GitHub repositorys to show what they are working on
* Since we know that for example Django is used, we can do a quick search for `Django security misconfigurations`
	* We eventually come across the following [repository](https://github.com/boomcamp/django-security) that describes OWASP Top10 for Django
* We can then check for these mistakes in the OpenSource project of the company

* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) offers a comprehensive search for employed, sorted by connections, locations, companies, school, industry, profile language, services, names, titles, and more
* Understandably, the more detailed information we provide there, the fewer results we get
* Suppose we are trying to find the infrastructure and technology the company is most likely to use
	* We should look for technical employees who work both in development and security
	* Because based on the security area and the employees who work in that area, we will also be able to determine what security measures the company has put in place to secure itself.
