### DNS
* `Domain Name System` (`DNS`)
* Resolves names into IP addresses
	* Does not have a central database
* Several types of DNS servers that are used worldwide

 ![](./Screenshots/Screenshot_2022-10-03_161330.png)

* Mainly unencrypted
* But encryption exists 
	* `DNS over TLS` (`DoT`)
	* `DNS over HTTPS` (`DoH`)
	* `NSCrypt` can encrypt traffic between the computer and the name server
* DNS also stores and outputs additional information about services associated with the domain
	* Which computer servers as the e-mail server
	* What the domain's name servers are called

### Default Configuration 
* Many configuration types
* All DNS servers work with three different types of configuration files
	1.  local DNS configuration files
	2.  zone files
	3.  reverse name resolution files
* [Bind9](https://www.isc.org/bind/) is very often used on Linux-based distributions
* Local configuration file (`named.conf`) is roughly divided into two sections
	* The Options section for general settings
	* The zone entries for the individual domains
	* A distinction is made between `global options` and `zone options`
		* Global options are general and affect all zones
		* A zone option only affects the zone to which it is assigned
		* Options not listed in named.conf have default values
		* If an option is both global and zone-specific, then the zone option takes precedence
	- `named.conf.local`
	- `named.conf.options`
	- `named.conf.log`

### Local DNS Configuration
```sh
cat /etc/bind/named.conf.local

//
// Do any local configuration here
//

// Consider adding the 1918 zones here, if they are not used in your
// organization
//include "/etc/bind/zones.rfc1918";
zone "domain.com" {
    type master;
    file "/etc/bind/db.domain.com";
    allow-update { key rndc-key; };
};
```

* In this file, local zones can be defined
* Zones are divided into different files which in most cases are mainly intended for one domain only
	* Exceptions are ISP and public DNS servers
* A `zone file` is a text file that describes a DNS zone with the BIND file format
	* BIND is the industry preferred zone file format
	* Describes a zone completely
	* There must be precisely one `SOA` record and at least one `NS` record
		* SOA usually located at the beginning of a zone file
* Goal of global rules is to improve readability of zone files
* Syntax errors make entire file unusable
	* Server responds with a `SERVFAIL` error message
* `forward records` are like a phone book where the DNS server looks up the addresses for the domain it is searching for

```sh
# cat /etc/bind/db.domain.com

;
; BIND reverse data file for local loopback interface
;
$ORIGIN domain.com
$TTL 86400
@     IN     SOA    dns1.domain.com.     hostmaster.domain.com. (
                    2001062501 ; serial
                    21600      ; refresh after 6 hours
                    3600       ; retry after 1 hour
                    604800     ; expire after 1 week
                    86400 )    ; minimum TTL of 1 day

      IN     NS     ns1.domain.com.
      IN     NS     ns2.domain.com.

      IN     MX     10     mx.domain.com.
      IN     MX     20     mx2.domain.com.

             IN     A       10.129.14.5

server1      IN     A       10.129.14.5
server2      IN     A       10.129.14.7
ns1          IN     A       10.129.14.2
ns2          IN     A       10.129.14.3

ftp          IN     CNAME   server1
mx           IN     CNAME   server1
mx2          IN     CNAME   server2
www          IN     CNAME   server2
```

* For the IP address to be resolved from the `Fully Qualified Domain Name` (`FQDN`), the DNS server must have a reverse lookup file
	* The computer name (FQDN) is assigned to the last octet of an IP address which corresponds to the respective host, using a `PTR` record
	* The PTR records are responsible for the reverse translation of IP addresses into names

### Reverse Name Resolution Zone Files
```sh
# cat /etc/bind/db.10.129.14

;
; BIND reverse data file for local loopback interface
;
$ORIGIN 14.129.10.in-addr.arpa
$TTL 86400
@     IN     SOA    dns1.domain.com.     hostmaster.domain.com. (
                    2001062501 ; serial
                    21600      ; refresh after 6 hours
                    3600       ; retry after 1 hour
                    604800     ; expire after 1 week
                    86400 )    ; minimum TTL of 1 day

      IN     NS     ns1.domain.com.
      IN     NS     ns2.domain.com.

5    IN     PTR    server1.domain.com.
7    IN     MX     mx.domain.com.
...SNIP...
```

### Footprinting the Service
* We make requests to the DNS server
* First we check which other name servers are known
	* We specify the server with `@` and the `ns` record

```sh
$ dig ns inlanefreight.htb @10.129.14.128

* `Zone transfer` refers to the transfer of zones to another server in DNS
	* `Asynchronous Full Transfer Zone` (`AXFR`)
* All servers must have the same data
	* Synchronization between the servers involved is realized by zone transfer
	* Using a secret key `rndc-key` the servers makes sure that they communicate with their own master or slave
* The original data of a zone is located on a DNS server, which is called the `primary` name server for this zone
	* To increase reliability, one or more additional servers are installed in practice in almost all cases, which are called `secondary` name servers for this zone
	* For some `Top-Level Domains` (`TLDs`), making zone files for the `Second Level Domains` accessible on at least two servers is mandatory
* DNS entries generally only created, modified, or deleted on primary
	* Either manually by editing zone file
	* Or automatically by a dynamic update from a database
* DNS server that serves as a direct source for synchronizing a zone file is called a master
* DNS server that obtains zone data from a master is called a slave
* Primary is always a master, secondary can be both
* Slave fetches `SOA` record of relevant zone from master at certain intervals (`refresh time`), and compares serial numbers
	* If serial of SOA record of the master is greater than that of the slave, the data sets no longer match
